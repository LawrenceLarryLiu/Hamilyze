# Hamilyze
## A Data Visualization Experience Centered Around "Hamilton: An American Musical"

### Inspiration
The musical Hamilton swept not only 11 Tony Awards, but also the hearts of millions over the world, including those of our team members. You may not be able to shell out thousands of dollars for a two-hour stay at the Richard Rodgers Theater (and if you are, it never hurts to learn more), so our group is bringing the musical experience directly to your computer screens with Hamilyze!

### Summary
Hamilyze is an interactive musical experience made possible through data visualization! Users can choose from their favorite Hamilton songs to listen to while they browse its lyrics and are treated to an animated display of visualized trends in lyrical data. The application finds motifs throughout all songs from the soundtrack and displays their frequency and presence in the song. The most significant musical motifs will be emphasized by size, as a large number of occurrences of each extended phrase directly relates to the size of the data point created. Each page also features an interactive scrollbar that will highlight the lyrics corresponding to the music being streamed in the embedded Spotify player. 

### We hope that you love Hamilyze as much as we do!
